House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

unfortuntely, Ned did live a long life

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Actually, this is entirely false. Joffrey is a bit of an annoying brat for a few books and then perishes in the most satisfying way possible.
